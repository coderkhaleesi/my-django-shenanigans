# my-django-shenanigans
This is a collection of all Django projects I have done till now, using tutorials or on my own.

NoBullshitOnlyAnswers
This app is inspired from the Answerly App by Tom Aratyn in his book Django 2.0.
It provides a basic started code or anyone who wants to build their own question-answer service like Quora, only this is less fancy.

To-do App
Again a starter code for a to-do web application. This was made in 4 hours using basic Django templates, ModelForms and bootstrap 4.0
